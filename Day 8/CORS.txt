Can we consume any api - if we get the URL ??? 
	No - security reason


By default - API applications will not share the data
	with the Http Feature called as CORS - cross origin resource shareing



		useing CORS u can decide, which url is accessible to which client / app

		eg. in my API if we have below controllers
			productListController 
				get (customer, admin)
				put (admin)
				post (admin)
				delete (admin)
			ordersController
				get ( customer, admin)
				put (custom)
				post (customer)
				delete (customer)
			walletController
				get (customer)
				put (NoOne) - interally to app
				post (NoOne) - internally to app
				delete (Noone) - intrernally to app

		user types are customer,admin

		JSOn placeholder, by default has CORS enabled for everyone, to read the data

---------------------
		By default - any API app in any framework(.net, java, node etc...) - CORS is disabled 
		in .net, we have to enable the CORS by adding CORS nuget package
		and then we have create a Policy (AppPolicy) in program.cs to configure the access 

		Note: CORS is not only about type of users, but also can help you to decide about
			IPaddress 
			Browsers (allow only chrome, no other browser)
			Allowed only to logged in user
			Allowed only from Indian address
