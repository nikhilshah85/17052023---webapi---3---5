As a webapi - developer
	a. Create web api 
	b. Consume webapi data / application in your fronrend 
			(static site, .net MVC, Java, NodeJS, PHP, Python etc...)

		2 Ways to do 
			a. Client side - Javascript based standard API - fetch API - this is W3C and Rest standard, part of modern browser

			This is the fastest but less secure not to be used for scencetive data

			b. server side - HttpClient - also a standard 
			This is safest, little bit slow compared to fetch
